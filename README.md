# fade-in-search
An additional method of implement site search calls for the search form to fade-in and fill the entire screen. This method, while certainly not applicable to every design, does have some benefits. First, the effect largely does not interfere with other design elements. Since the search from appears as a full-screen overlay, you do not have to perfrom any css jiu jitsu to accomodate the new element. Furthermore, with the search form full screen you give clear focus for your end users.
